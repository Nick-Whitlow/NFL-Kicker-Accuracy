        <h3>Just how accurate does one have to be to kick in the NFL?</h3>
        <p> We will be investigating just how consistent one must be to kick in the NFL. We will look into statistics as to how consistent kickers are from 2010 to 2016 and see just what it takes to suit up and play on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Check out the interactive dashboard to see how many field goals and extra points kickers have made and attempted throughout 6 season. Then you can see the high percentages in which the kickers in the 2016 season were making field goals and extra points. </p>
